(** Move continuations upwards to try to reduce duplication when
    inlining.  (In previous versions of Flambda this pass used to operate
    on normal [Let] expressions; that is no longer required since we no
    longer have nested scopes for those.  However nested scopes do still
    exist in the context of continuations.  Avoiding that would require
    something like converting to SSA form.)
